# Keyboard Talker (2015)

A text-to-speech chat toy tied to an on-screen keyboard.  [Live Demo](http://play.killglare.com/kbdtlkr)


### Speech Synthesis

The speech synthesis is accomplished 100% in the browser using [meSpeak.js](http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/), client-side JavaScript text-to-speech library based on the [speak.js](https://github.com/kripken/speak.js/) project. Speak.js is an [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) port of the [C++ eSpeak library](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/). 

### Design

The on-screen keyboard is pure CSS, designed by the talented Kentuckian [Dustin Cartwright](http://dustincartwright.com/). The other elements are [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Obviously. 

### Mobile Support
Absolutely not. 

### Other technologies used to make this

Angular.js, Angular UI (screen name modal), Grunt, Bower, Firebase
